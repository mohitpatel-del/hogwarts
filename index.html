                <p>Admission to Hogwarts is selective, in that children who show magical ability will automatically gain a place, and squibs cannot attend the school as students.A magical quill at Hogwarts detects the birth of magical children and writes
                    their names into a large parchment book, but there is no admission test because "you are either magical or you are not." Every year, a teacher checks this book and sends a letter to the children who are turning eleven. Acceptance or
                    refusal of a place at Hogwarts must be posted by 31 July.</p>

                <p>The primary mode of transport to Hogwarts is the Hogwarts Express that students take at the start of each school year. Students board the train from hidden Platform 9¾ at King's Cross station in London. The train arrives near Hogwarts,
                    some time after nightfall. From there, first-year students are accompanied by the "Keeper of the Keys, Game and Grounds" (which was Hagrid) to small boats, which magically sail across the lake and get them near the entrance of Hogwarts.
                    The older students ride up to the castle in carriages pulled by creatures called Thestrals. When the first-year students initially arrive at the castle, they wait in a small chamber off the entrance hall until the older students have
                    taken their seats, and then enter the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony to determine their House assignments.</p>

                <p>Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder: <b>Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff.</b> Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining
                    and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Each house also has
                    its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup.</p>
